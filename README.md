# IrisStein
Shitty and laggy raycaster engine in the Iris engine by Ciastex.

# Bugs/Issues
Iris is bugged so sprites wont render unless you use my fork, and shit will immediately crash if you dont as well  
Sprites flip upside down if you get close and turn around  
Everything is so fuckin slow  
Sprites aren't hidden by walls (no idea how to achieve this, I tried)  
Folders are misnamed (was originally going to make doom then realize that no thanks)  
Yes, i'm literally just slashing the res in 3rds for more performance, shh.
